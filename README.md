# Automatic License Plate Detection using YOLOv8 and EasyOCR

This project focuses on automatically detecting and recognizing vehicle license plates using YOLOv8 for object detection and EasyOCR for text extraction.
YOLOv8 is used to accurately locate license plates in images or video streams, while EasyOCR reads and converts the detected plate into text.

The system can handle images from various environments, making it suitable for applications such as traffic surveillance, parking management, and toll collection. 
The combination of these technologies ensures a fast and efficient license plate recognition system.
